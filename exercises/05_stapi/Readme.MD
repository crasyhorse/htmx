API Documentation: https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/common/download/stapi.yaml

Create an HTML search form that enables the user to search for Star Trek episodes by name or title. You have to use the POST /v1/rest/episode/search endpoint.

You may use Bulma to create a pretty layout for your form like in the exercises before.
