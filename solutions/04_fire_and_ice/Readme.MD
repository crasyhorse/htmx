An API of fire and ice
======================

URL: https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation

Create an HTML form that uses anapioficeandfire.com to generate a list of all characters from the Fire and Ice universe. The form should enable the user to filter the list by "name" and "culture". Hint: use {{#.}} and {{/.}} to render unnamed lists.

You may use Bulma to create a pretty layout for your form like in the exercises before.
